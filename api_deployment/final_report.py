API Endpoints:
-------------
1. GET /health - System health check
2. POST /train - Retrain model with new data
3. GET /predict - Generate revenue forecast
   Parameters: country (required), date (required), forecast_days (optional)
4. GET /logs - Retrieve API logs
5. GET /logs/predictions - Retrieve prediction logs
6. GET /logs/download - Download logs as CSV
7. GET /metrics - Get performance metrics

Deployment Architecture:
----------------------
• Application: Flask API running in Docker container
• Database: SQLite for logging (PostgreSQL recommended for production)
